        I started my journey with programming on Commodore64 with Basic when I was a child and made small games for myself. After some time in middle school, I became acquainted with the game engine AGS, GameMaker, and 3d GameStudio and made small projects on Windows and DOS. I made games with Game Maker for many years, until in 2014 I became acquainted with the Unity game engine and learned C# with it. After that, I worked in game companies and always worked as a developer of Unity. In each company, I did a variety of Unity-based projects such as AR, VR, MobileGame and Intracive Animation and participated in most parts of the project. 
        I also leaned some skills such as animation, 3D modeling and other skills related to game developing to develope my own projects.
