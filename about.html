        I started my journey with programming on Commodore64 with Basic when I was a child and made small games for myself and solve my math homeworks . After spend some time in the middle school, I became acquainted with the game engine AGS, GameMaker, and 3d GameStudio and made small projects on Windows and DOS. I made many games with Game Maker for many years, until in 2014 I became acquainted with the Unity game engine and learned C# with it. After that, I worked in game companies and always worked as a Unity developer. In each company, I did a variety of Unity-based projects such as AR, VR, MobileGame and Intractive Animation and participated in most parts of the project. 
        I also learned some skills such as animation, 3D modeling and other skills related to game developing to develope my own projects or work in other positions in other companies.
