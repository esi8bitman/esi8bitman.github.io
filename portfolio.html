            <a>
                I searched and tested many shooter mobile games. But I can’t find something like “StarFox”. So I decided
                to make a game with the taste of SNES StarFox. I’m trying to make this game so light to install on every
                device and so easy to control and play it. The best thing about it is that the levels are JSON files and
                I can have many new levels for it. You can install the alpha version of that.

            <a>
                I like to make a third platformer game for an android and PC. So I decided to make a great character
                controller with good technical things like dynamic foots , animated gun shots with code, changing
                weapons and many dynamic things that are used for most third person games and all things are great
                challenges for me. I worked on it in my free time and I hope to make it better.

            <br>
            <a>
                I wanted to make a game for famicom when I was a kid. So I tried to make a retro platformer game with
                all famicom standards. My references are Mega Man and Duck Tales. The best thing about this game is , I
                did all of the things of the game from Idea to be published. Game design , programming , making all arts
                , composing music and other things I did by myself. The hardest part for me was game design and level
                design. I use game maker studio 1.4 to make the game. I’ll be so happy if you play it and write a
                comment for me about how it was that?

            <br>
            <a>
                Just imagine you have a paint gallery. You can design your paintings on the wall and make a great
                beautiful view for
                visitors. Visitors are coming to your place with VR devices. This is my idea to make a VR application in
                2018 with
                Unity. Making custom paints with frames and fixing them on the wall was the challenge. That’s canceled
                because I can’t
                find an investor. And now you can test my demo on itch.io…

                This is a 4v4 soccer game for android. The big challenge for me is the behavior of the NPCs. But the
                game was canceled
                by the owner of it. So put it on Itch.io for the test.
                I made models with Blender and made the game with Unity.
